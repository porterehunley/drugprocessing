We hypothesize that immediate post-operative pain will be improved with pre-operative administration of gabapentin.

We plan to conduct a prospective randomized trial to assess the effect of a single immediate pre-operative dose of gabapentin 300mg on immediate post-operative pain in patients undergoing laparoscopy for gynecologic indications. This concept has been studied in patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy. We aim to study the effect on patients undergoing laparoscopy."

3,NCT01977937,Difference in Pain Control When Adding Gabapentin to a Multimodal Pain Management Protocol in Pediatric Post-operative Posterior Spinal Fusion Patients.,Primary,"['Pain, Postoperative']","Pain, Postoperative",Pain Control in Pediatric Posterior Spine Fusion Patients: The Effect of Gabapentin on Post-operative Opioid Use and Patient Satisfaction,"Patients aged 10-19 years with idiopathic scoliosis, and classified as American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) class I to III who intended to undergo posterior spinal fusion for deformity correction were enrolled. Prior to surgery, subjects were randomized into either the experimental or control group by the OHSU research pharmacy using an online randomization tool, which utilized block randomization upon patient enrollment to result in equal sized groups at study completion. Patients, caretakers and providers remained blinded to the group assignments.

Patients filled out the Scoliosis Research Society, SRS-22 standardized form at a pre-operative clinic appointment. Following hospital admission, patients recorded initial pain level with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) prior to receiving standardized pre-operative medications. The VAS scale used in this study was a 10 cm line with anchors of ""no pain"" at the left and ""worst pain imaginable"" at the right; each point was measured to the nearest millimeter. In the post-operative period, nursing staff assessed patient pain using the VAS at 4-hour intervals from 06:00 until 22:00 for the duration of hospitalization for a minimum of 4 daily scores recorded per patient. After the third post-operative day, but before discharge, the parent or guardian of each subject was asked to complete an IRB-approved survey to measure parent demographics and parental satisfaction with the patient's hospitalization and pain control.

Each patient received standardized medications according to our multimodal pain protocol. Following hospital admission, patients in both groups received one 12.5 mg/kg dose of intravenous (IV) acetaminophen. Patients in the experimental group received one 15 mg/kg dose of liquid gabapentin while the control group received a placebo, formulated to match the volume, color, taste, and smell of the experimental medication. The gabapentin or placebo was prepared by the OHSU research pharmacists so that providers and investigators remained blinded to treatment assignment. Several intraoperative anesthetic medications were given to subjects in both groups including: IV ketamine at 5mcg/kg/min for 120 minutes and IV Ketorolac 0.5mg/kg up to 15mg. Intra-operative IV propofol and IV hydromorphone were titrated to desired effect.In the post-operative period, gabapentin was administered to the experimental group at 10mg/kg PO q8h, beginning at Phase II and continued through postoperative day four. The control group received equivalent volume doses of placebo at the same intervals. Post-operative medication was administered according to the following protocol for both groups: ketorolac continued at 0.5mg/kg up to 15mg IV q6h for 12 total doses. Once ketorolac doses were complete, the patient may have received Ibuprofen 10mg/kg up to 600mg PO as needed. Hydromorphone was given through patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) at a basal dose of 0.002mg/kg/hr for 24 hours and demand dose of 0.004mg/kg with an 8-minute lockout. Once basal PCA was discontinued, administration of oxycodone 0.1-0.2mg/kg PO up to 15mg PO q4h as needed supplemented the PCA demand dose. If the patient tolerated PO oxycodone without emesis, the PCA hydromorphone was discontinued after 24 hours, but a rescue dose of hydromorphone 0.002mg IV q4 was available if needed. Other as needed medications included diazepam 0.15mg/kg up to 5mg PO q6h for muscle spasms, ondansetron 0.1mg/kg up to 4mg IV q12h for nausea, and IV acetaminophen 12.5mg/kg up to 1000mg q6h. Acetaminophen 12.5mg/kg up to 650mg PO q6h hours was administered after the IV was removed. All patients received one Senokot-S tablet and Miralax 0.8 g/kg up to 17g daily for bowel regimen.

For the entire hospitalization, nursing staff monitored vital signs and assessed sedation using the standardized Pasero Opioid-induced Sedation Scale (POSS) protocols at 4-hour intervals.16 Any POSS score of 3 or greater resulted in more frequent monitoring of respiratory status and sedation level, decreased opioid dosing, and administration of naloxone as needed. All patients were routinely monitored for known adverse gabapentin drug reactions including: peripheral edema, nausea/emesis, viral disease, ataxia, dizziness, nystagmus, somnolence, hostile behavior, fatigue and fever, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug hypersensitivity reactions, drug induced coma/seizure, and suicidal thoughts. Any perceived adverse reaction would have resulted in the gabapentin or placebo being stopped at the clinicians' discretion"

Electronically entered daily diaries will be used to determine if pain is lower in PVD subjects when treated with gabapentin (up to 3600 mg/d) compared to when treated with placebo. Biological measurements will include assessment of allodynia and hyperalgesia from capsaicin administration, muscle tension using a vaginal pressure algometer, number of tender points by clinical examination, and changes in blood pressure, pulse and heart rate variability. . The Long-range goals of this project are to explicate the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms of PVD, and to use this knowledge to create evidence-based differential diagnoses of subtypes of PVD and to individualize treatments for each subtype. The immediate goal is to conduct a multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT) of gabapentin treatment for PVD, and which will also provide critical data on a new PVD-testing and response paradigm, as well as on characteristics that may define subtypes of PVD. Gabapentin, an anticonvulsant with analgesic, anxiolytic, and antispasmotic effects, was selected because of its efficacy in treating other neuropathic pain conditions."

11,NCT03123861,Pain During Normal Activities (Surgical Pain Scale Item 2),Primary,['Pelvic Organ Prolapse'],Pelvic Organ Prolapse,Randomized Controlled Trial of Gabapentin Versus Placebo for Postoperative Pain After Sacrospinous Ligament Fixation for Pelvic Organ Prolapse,"Pelvic organ prolapse (POP), the herniation of the bladder, uterus, or rectum, into and often beyond, the vaginal opening, affects 40% of postmenopausal women and significantly impairs quality of life. POP is often managed surgically, and currently, one in every eight women will undergo POP surgery during her lifetime.

A commonly performed procedure for POP is a sacrospinous ligament fixation (SSLF), which is a vaginal surgery that involves suspending the vaginal apex to the sacrospinous ligament suspension with sutures. Beyond routine postoperative pain, a sacrospinous ligament fixation may result in significant gluteal pain as a result of the vaginal sutures affecting/impinging on the sacral nerve roots. Unfortunately, postoperative gluteal pain is not uncommon with 12% of patients reporting significant gluteal pain and 4% having persistent pain 6 weeks after surgery.

This study aims to compare the impact of gabapentin versus placebo on postoperative pain after SSLF. The rationale is that studies have shown that preoperative gabapentin, a non-opioid analgesic, resulted in a lower narcotic use postoperatively. Decreasing the use of standard of care postoperative narcotic pain medications would also decrease adverse events due to narcotics such as nausea, vomiting, and constipation, and potentially decrease the long-term risk of opioid dependence. As an additional benefit, a careful assessment of actual opioid will help to inform best practices for prescribing, as we may be overprescribing narcotic medications for this type of surgery. This study will evaluate a longer two-week course of gabapentin because it is currently standard of care to use gabapentin to treat neuropathic pain after SSLF; thus, gabapentin may help to address overall pain as well as neuropathic gluteal pain that can occur after SSLF. Furthermore, gabapentin is a relatively safe medication with the primary adverse events being dizziness and sedation.

Given the risk of overall postoperative pain and neuropathic gluteal pain after a sacrospinous ligament fixation for POP and the evidence that perioperative gabapentin may decrease acute pain and neuropathic pain, this study proposes a novel randomized trial to compare perioperative gabapentin versus placebo on postoperative pain after a vaginal SSLF surgery."

The study is a cross-over design. Prior to screening subjects are required to have a demonstrated history of an inadequate response (as determined by the investigator) to at least 1800 mg/day of gabapentin. Prior history of treatment with gabapentin includes current treatment at 1800mg/day (2 weeks) or prior treatment with ≥1800mg/day (4 weeks). Subjects could also have been treated with pregabalin monotherapy (150-300mg/day, ≥4 weeks) and had an inadequate response.

Subjects are treated with gabapentin 1800mg/day during the Baseline Period and are randomized if during the Basleline Period they are compliant with gabapentin treatment and have a 24-hour average pain intensity score ≥4.0 based on an 11-point pain intensity numerical rating scale (PI-NRS). Subjects are then randomized to receive gabapentin enacarbil (either 1200mg/day or 3600mg/day in a 1:1 ratio) for Treatment Period 1 (28 days). Followed by a dose of 2400mg/day for 4 days and the alternate fixed dose (either 3600 mg/day or 1200 mg/day) for Treatment Period 2 (28 days)."

141,NCT00108550,Transformed Descriptor Differential Scale-Pain Intensity Scores Adjusted for Time,Primary,['Chronic Low Back Pain'],Chronic Low Back Pain,Efficacy of Antidepressants in Chronic Back Pain,"Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a major health problem for the VA, affecting up to 15% of all veterans. Nationally, its medical and disability costs exceed $50 billion annually. Despite its impact, relatively little research evaluates treatment for CLBP. Wide variation in patterns of care suggests uncertainty over effective therapy. Most chronic back cases are not surgical candidates. The mainstays of medical treatment have been non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), muscle relaxants, opioids, and antidepressants. Non-steroidal drugs and muscle relaxants are effective for acute but not for chronic back pain. Opioids may provide analgesia but safety limits their use. Tricyclic antidepressants provide modest pain relief, separate from effects on depression. But it is clear additional research is needed to develop more effective pharmacotherapy. One approach favored by many authorities is determining if agents effective for one type of chronic pain syndrome (e.g., diabetic neuropathy) can be generalized to other syndromes, like chronic back pain. Another is to identify effective drug combinations, based on selecting drugs with differing therapeutic mechanisms.

This research is a program of rigorous randomized clinical trials testing the efficacy of antidepressants for analgesia in chronic back pain. Because chronic pain is a complex disorder, the program features a multidisciplinary research team, involving specialists in psychiatry, orthopedic surgery, psychology, anesthesiology, clinical pharmacology, and biomathematics. The research has both pragmatic and explanatory aims. Our strategy has been to test antidepressants with differing, and selective properties in an attempt to isolate therapeutic mechanisms. Thus, we began with trials using selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), rather than those with dual noradrenergic and serotonergic effects (e.g., amitriptyline, imipramine). To ensure applicability of results, we have used rigorous diagnostic procedures to identify patients with chronic back pain due to degenerative disk disease. To enhance generalizability we recruit primary care patients rather than tertiary pain clinic samples. Patients without major depression are studied to examine analgesia separate from antidepressant effects. Secondary outcomes address function and life quality.

We have conducted three controlled trials using identical recruitment and assessment methodology. The first, comparing a noradrenergic antidepressant (nortriptyline) with placebo, indicated that the noradrenergic agent provided clinically relevant analgesia. The second was a head-to-head comparison of a selective noradrenergic agent (maprotiline) with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI, paroxetine). The noradrenergic agent outperformed the SSRI, which was equivalent to placebo. To clarify these results we explored whether efficacy might be evident only at specific drug concentrations. Therefore, the third study, has a prospective concentration design comparing the most potent and selective noradrenergic antidepressant (desipramine) to the standard SSRI, fluoxetine. Subjects were randomized to placebo or predetermined concentration windows reflecting low, medium, and high exposure to study drugs and followed for 12 weeks. Interim analysis suggests that low concentration desipramine outperforms placebo (p<0.05). It is also superior to mid-concentration and high exposure desipramine--as well as all exposure levels of the SSRI, which are equivalent to placebo.

In sum, all three studies supported noradrenergic analgesia in CLBP, and the two studies that evaluated SSRIs failed to find analgesia. This suggests noradrenergic activity, perhaps within a therapeutic window, may be primarily responsible for back pain analgesia. These findings have led us away from studies proposing combining noradrenergic and serotonergic agents. An alternative approach which builds on these data, but first employs another class of agents, seems reasonable. This strategy is to assess if gabapentin, a calcium channel blocker agent with demonstrated efficacy in neuropathic pain, can be extended to chronic back pain.

We conducted a double-blind, randomized assignment, 12-week, placebo controlled clinical trial of the efficacy of gabapentin. Non-depressed chronic low back pain patients (N = 130) will be randomized to placebo or high dose gabapentin (3600 mg/day or maximum tolerable dose). Analysis was by intent to treat. The primary efficacy assessment is mean pain intensity (Descriptor Differential Scale, DDS) at exit. Secondary outcomes are function and life quality (Oswestry Disability Index, Short Form-36, Quality of Well-Being Scale). Safety evaluation includes rating adverse events (Scandinavian Society of Psychopharmacology Committee on Clinical Investiagations Side Effects Rating Scale, UKU), standardized physical examination, and clinical laboratory testing. Results could provide explanatory insight into mechanisms of back pain, and address the pragmatic clinical need by primary care providers and others for effective therapy."

Non-depressed chronic low back pain patients (N = 130) will be randomized to placebo or high dose gabapentin (3600 mg/day or maximum tolerable dose). Analysis was by intent to treat. The primary efficacy assessment is mean pain intensity (Descriptor Differential Scale, DDS) at exit. Secondary outcomes are function and life quality (Oswestry Disability Index, Short Form-36, Quality of Well-Being Scale). Safety evaluation includes rating adverse events (Scandinavian Society of Psychopharmacology Committee on Clinical Investiagations Side Effects Rating Scale, UKU), standardized physical examination, and clinical laboratory testing. Results could provide explanatory insight into mechanisms of back pain, and address the pragmatic clinical need by primary care providers and others for effective therapy."

159,NCT02155257,Resting Pupil Diameter,Primary,['Osteoarthritis'],Osteoarthritis,A Feasibility Study: Understanding and Altering Pain Expectations in Subjects With Osteoarthritis of the Knee or Hip,"Purpose and rationale for this study: Both chronic pain and disability after total knee replacement surgery are predicted by negative cognitive-affective state, characterized by depression, anxiety, and a cognitive style dominated by catastrophizing. How this negative state results in chronic pain and disability is not known, but we hypothesize that it causes dysfunction of the release of the neurotransmitter, norepinephrine in several regions of the brain, mid-brain, and spinal cord that are important to many processes involved in recovery from surgery.

Objectives: (1) Gabapentin and modafinil will increase resting pupil diameter with a moderate effect size in patients with osteoarthritis; (2) Expectations will modify pain experience with a moderate effect size in these patients

Methods: 30 subjects with moderate average daily pain from osteoarthritis of the knee or hip or healthy subjects will be recruited and will come to the clinical research unit at Wake Forest. Informed consent will be confirmed and they will complete the questionnaires. We will take a verbal medical and medication history and obtain blood pressure and heart rate measurements. Verbal pain intensity report (0-10 from no pain to worst pain imaginable) will be obtained from a 5 second heat stimuli, separated by 30 seconds, delivered to a nonpainful area of skin on the arm as described in preliminary data. During pain testing, study subjects will sit in a comfortable chair in a low-ambient light room with their head positioned on a chin rest for continuous recording of pupil diameter using a near infrared recording system as described in preliminary data. Pupil diameter and probe temperature will be passed through an analog to digital converter and acquired at 60 Hertz (Hz) for subsequent analysis.

Five sequences of test stimuli will be presented, with a brief break in between each sequence. The first sequence will consist of 7 stimuli, from 39⁰ to 51⁰ Celsius (C) in 2⁰C increments, in ascending order. Data from this training sequence will not be used for analysis. Sequences 2 and 3 will consist of 5, 5-second stimuli, presented in random order, to generate moderate (50⁰C) and mild (47⁰C) pain (random condition). Sequences 4 and 5 will also consist of random presentation of 5 stimuli at these temperatures, but with different auditory tones 6 s prior to stimulus onset to correctly cue the stimulus temperature (cued condition).

Subjects will then be randomized to receive oral gabapentin, 900 milligram (mg), modafinil, 200 mg, or placebo, followed 2 hours later by pain testing with pupillometry, consisting of different sequences. The random and cued paradigms will be presented twice each followed by a sequence with one miscue in the positive expectation for pain direction (signal for 50⁰C but deliver 47⁰C) and one in the negative expectation for pain direction. Subjects will provide verbal pain intensity scores after each stimulus."

All current neuropathic pain drugs have approximately the same efficacy of less than 30% in controlled trials, and many of these drugs do not have known mechanisms of action. fMRI studies may provide insight into how brain circuitry is altered by chronic pain, and how these drugs act on altered circuitry. The trigeminal system in particular offers unique advantages for studying such alterations, including a large central representation and high degree of somatotopy. The administration of lamotrigine to neuropathic pain patients in conjunction with fMRI will allow us to compare subjective ratings of pain with objective measures of neural activity during increased conditions of allodynia/hyperalgesia."

The fastest growth in lumbar surgery in the U.S. this past decade has occurred in older adults with LSS and the rate of complex fusion procedures has increased 15-fold. These surgical procedures are associated with significant health care costs, risks, complications, and re-hospitalization rates. Yet, evidence is lacking for the effectiveness of the various non-surgical treatments offered to patients with LSS. This knowledge gap has greatly hindered the development of clinical practice guidelines relevant to the non-surgical treatment approaches for LSS.

OBJECTIVES: This study will perform a comparison of three common approaches to the non-surgical management and treatment of patients with LSS. The specific research questions associated with this study are: (1) How do group exercise and manual therapy with rehabilitative exercise compare with medical care? (2) How do group exercise and manual therapy with rehabilitative exercise compare with each other? (3) Are there any baseline predictors associated with clinical improvement in any of these non-surgical treatment approaches? The long term objective of this study is to produce research evidence relevant to community stakeholders and to inform better decision making about non-surgical treatment options available to LSS patients.

METHODS: This will be a comparative effectiveness study utilizing the research design of a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT). It will be a 3-group RCT that allows for pragmatic treatment approaches in each of the three study arms. The study sample will consist of 259 older adults (>60 years) who have symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of LSS, which will be confirmed by clinical examination and diagnostic imaging. Eligible subjects will be randomized into one of three pragmatic treatment approaches: 1) medical care; 2) group exercise; or 3) manual therapy with rehabilitative exercise.

All subjects will be treated for a 6-week course of care. Primary outcome measures are two validated research measurement tools; the Swiss Spinal Stenosis Questionnaire (self-reported pain/function) and the Self Paced Walking Test (performance-based measure). We will also employ a novel secondary outcome measure; the Sense Wear Armband which provides a real-time measure of physical activity during normal daily living."

Current treatments include vulvar care measure, topical medications, oral medications, biofeedback, physical therapy and surgery. The usual treatment is to have the patient take either tricyclic antidepressants or anti convulsants orally, however these methods seldom bring total relief. These drugs do have significant side effects limiting the patient's tolerance of the higher does sometimes needed. An effective topical medication would greatly benefit these women with fewer side effects and better tolerance. Topical amitriptyline and baclofen are often prescribed, but no studies have been done to support their use. Topical gabapentin has also been shown to have good effect, but no prospective clinical study as been done.

This study will test topical application of Cetaphil, Loperamide, Gabapentin, Ketoprofen, Ketamine and Amitriptyline over a 19 week period in the first phase of the study. The drugs are compounded by the University of Rochester research pharmacy and dispensed in 19 vials, one vial to be used each week. Patients and study personnel are blinded as to which drug is being used. Each study participant was given a week of placebo at the initiation of the study. Each study compound, which contains both the drug and the base (Cetaphil) will be used twice a day for two weeks in a row, followed by a one week washout of base alone. If a patient finds that one of the drugs is effective she may stop participation after the first 13 weeks and request that the most effective drug be prescribed for her. The unblinding officer would then work with the research pharmacy to identify the effective drug and provide the patient with a prescription for that drug. If the patient desires, she may enroll in the second phase of the study when she will test the last two drugs over a six week period with the washout as in the first segment of the study. The drugs would be administered in vials as in the first section of the study.

Every week on Sunday the patient will complete an electronic diary, recording her daily pain, any drug side effects, pain with the tampon test and overall health. Every three weeks she will complete the Female Sexual Function Index on the same electronic system. She would start her new drug on Monday each week. Additionally the coordinator of the study will call each patient on Wednesday to see if they are having any problems with the drug started on Monday.

Justification for the project

One half of all pregnancies among American women are unintended, with nearly 4 in 10 ending in pregnancy termination by abortion. Elective abortions are among the most common outpatient surgical procedure, with an estimated 46 million performed worldwide annually. The management of pain is critical to patient care throughout the abortion experience since the vast majority of women will experience pain with the procedure. Patients are most affected by pain during paracervical block, cervical dilation, suction aspiration, and post operatively with uterine cramping. Innovation in pain control and reduction of anxiety, nausea and vomiting using a low cost, well-tolerated intervention could impact thousands of women each year.

Proposed research

This is a randomized controlled trial of gabapentin 600 mg compared to placebo given 1-2 hours preoperatively in conjunction with perioperative paracervical block for surgical abortion. The researchers hypothesize that adding gabapentin to local anesthesia will reduce perioperative and postoperative pain associated with surgical abortion. Additionally, the researchers hypothesize that gabapentin will reduce nausea, vomiting, anxiety, and consumption of pain medication.

New features

Gabapentin as an adjunct o pain management has proven beneficial in gynecological surgery. Its use in similar surgical settings as an adjunct to pain management regiments has proven to be beneficial. It is generally well tolerated, inexpensive, has minimal side effects, and few contraindications.

Problems anticipated

The high volume at the study clinic will benefit recruitment efforts, however, as the coordination of this study may potentially disrupt clinic flow there will be limits on daily recruitment. Postoperative follow-up may be challenging, thus to reduce the impact of loss to follow-up, most of the outcomes are measured on the same day as the procedure. Further, multiple contact approaches will be employed and a second incentive offered after completion of the postoperative assessment."

Justification for the project

One half of all pregnancies among American women are unintended, with nearly 4 in 10 ending in pregnancy termination by abortion. Elective abortions are among the most common outpatient surgical procedure, with an estimated 46 million performed worldwide annually. The management of pain is critical to patient care throughout the abortion experience since the vast majority of women will experience pain with the procedure. Patients are most affected by pain during paracervical block, cervical dilation, suction aspiration, and post operatively with uterine cramping. Innovation in pain control and reduction of anxiety, nausea and vomiting using a low cost, well-tolerated intervention could impact thousands of women each year.

Proposed research

This is a randomized controlled trial of gabapentin 600 mg compared to placebo given 1-2 hours preoperatively in conjunction with perioperative paracervical block for surgical abortion. The researchers hypothesize that adding gabapentin to local anesthesia will reduce perioperative and postoperative pain associated with surgical abortion. Additionally, the researchers hypothesize that gabapentin will reduce nausea, vomiting, anxiety, and consumption of pain medication.

New features

Gabapentin as an adjunct o pain management has proven beneficial in gynecological surgery. Its use in similar surgical settings as an adjunct to pain management regiments has proven to be beneficial. It is generally well tolerated, inexpensive, has minimal side effects, and few contraindications.

308,NCT02703259,Narcotic Use at 24 Hours Postop,Primary,"['Pain, Postoperative']","Pain, Postoperative",Single Dose Preoperative Gabapentin Use in Minimally Invasive Hysterectomy for Acute Pain Management,"Multimodal postoperative analgesia after a hysterectomy has been mainly based on a combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids. However, adverse effects including nausea, vomiting, sedation, and pruritus may limit use of opioids. As the side effects are dose related, minimizing opioid exposure may significantly reduce these risks. Thus, there has been an interest in evaluating preemptive as well as post-operative administration of non-opioids. Additional regimens have been suggested to minimize opioid use and its associated adverse effects including injection of local anesthetics, epidural analgesia, and anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin or pregabalin.

Gabapentin, a widely used anticonvulsant used for treatment of neuropathic pain, has recently been suggested to improve postoperative analgesia and reduce opioid requirements. Gabapentin is thought to modulate calcium channels on the presynaptic nociceptive neurons, which in turn modulate or inhibit the release of excitatory neurotransmitters from activated nociceptors. In addition to inhibiting pain transmission, gabapentin may exert an analgesic effect by activating descending inhibitory noradrenergic pathways.

Many studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of gabapentin for perioperative use in a variety of procedures across disciplines including thoracotomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, tonsillectomy, major orthopedic surgery, cesarean sections, and abdominal hysterectomy. Several randomized trials have evaluated the effects of gabapentin administered preoperatively only as well as given pre- and postoperatively for hysterectomy. In a systematic review of 14 studies conducted between 2004 and 2013, with samples ranging from 40 to 200, investigators identified 8 trials in which gabapentin was administered only preoperatively to reduce pain associated with abdominal hysterectomy surgery. Analysis of those data clearly demonstrates that preemptive gabapentin reduced the postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) pain score by approximately 50% and postoperative use of morphine by approximately 37%. The incidence of pruritus and dry mouth in those receiving preemptive gabapentin appeared similar to those receiving placebo, however there was a higher rate of reported dizziness (not statistically significant) associated with gabapentin. In contrast, multiple postoperative doses of gabapentin in addition to the preoperative dose was found to have no significant effect on VAS scores at 24 hours, thus favoring a single preoperative dose.

Although initial results have been encouraging, uptake of gabapentin in routine clinical use remains limited due to mixed results and variability between gabapentin protocols, including dosing and duration. Christiana Care Health System (CCHS) plans to implement the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol which administers preoperative medications to reduce postoperative pain, including acetaminophen, celecoxib, dexamethasone, and gabapentin. Therefore the aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a single dose of preoperative gabapentin protocol to reduce acute postoperative pain in women undergoing a minimally invasive hysterectomy."

In contrast, multiple postoperative doses of gabapentin in addition to the preoperative dose was found to have no significant effect on VAS scores at 24 hours, thus favoring a single preoperative dose.

Although initial results have been encouraging, uptake of gabapentin in routine clinical use remains limited due to mixed results and variability between gabapentin protocols, including dosing and duration. Christiana Care Health System (CCHS) plans to implement the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol which administers preoperative medications to reduce postoperative pain, including acetaminophen, celecoxib, dexamethasone, and gabapentin. Therefore the aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a single dose of preoperative gabapentin protocol to reduce acute postoperative pain in women undergoing a minimally invasive hysterectomy."
311,NCT02703259,Number of Patient With Gabapentin Adverse Effects at 2 Weeks Postoperatively,Secondary,"['Pain, Postoperative']","Pain, Postoperative",Single Dose Preoperative Gabapentin Use in Minimally Invasive Hysterectomy for Acute Pain Management,"Multimodal postoperative analgesia after a hysterectomy has been mainly based on a combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids. However, adverse effects including nausea, vomiting, sedation, and pruritus may limit use of opioids. As the side effects are dose related, minimizing opioid exposure may significantly reduce these risks. Thus, there has been an interest in evaluating preemptive as well as post-operative administration of non-opioids. Additional regimens have been suggested to minimize opioid use and its associated adverse effects including injection of local anesthetics, epidural analgesia, and anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin or pregabalin.

Gabapentin, a widely used anticonvulsant used for treatment of neuropathic pain, has recently been suggested to improve postoperative analgesia and reduce opioid requirements. Gabapentin is thought to modulate calcium channels on the presynaptic nociceptive neurons, which in turn modulate or inhibit the release of excitatory neurotransmitters from activated nociceptors. In addition to inhibiting pain transmission, gabapentin may exert an analgesic effect by activating descending inhibitory noradrenergic pathways.

Many studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of gabapentin for perioperative use in a variety of procedures across disciplines including thoracotomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, tonsillectomy, major orthopedic surgery, cesarean sections, and abdominal hysterectomy. Several randomized trials have evaluated the effects of gabapentin administered preoperatively only as well as given pre- and postoperatively for hysterectomy. In a systematic review of 14 studies conducted between 2004 and 2013, with samples ranging from 40 to 200, investigators identified 8 trials in which gabapentin was administered only preoperatively to reduce pain associated with abdominal hysterectomy surgery. Analysis of those data clearly demonstrates that preemptive gabapentin reduced the postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) pain score by approximately 50% and postoperative use of morphine by approximately 37%.

Gabapentin can be effective as Bisoprolol in reduction of intraoperative bleeding, improving the operative's field visibility and increase the surgeon satisfaction via optimization of blood pressure and heart rate.

Objectives Compare the effect of preoperative Gabapentin with Bisoprolol on hemodynamics, surgical field optimization during endoscopic nasal surgeries.

Technical design:

A) Site of study :

The study was conducted at Anesthesia and Surgical intensive care and Otorhinolaryngology departments, faculty of medicine, Zagazig University.

B) Sample Size :

According to 80% power of the study, 95% CI and calculated volume of blood loss 200±40 ml and 150±55ml on Gabapentin (22) and Bisoprolol (15) premedication respectively, the estimated Sample size was 54 patients (open EPI) , 63 patients were included in the study to compensate for drop out.

Randomization was carried out on 63 patients to compensate for drop out . All planned ESS procedures was managed by the same anesthetist and surgeon who were blinded to the used study's premedication. The surgeon was blinded to the monitor recording the hemodynamic variables.

All patients had been preoperatively evaluated according to standard local protocol. Preoperative surgical preparation and proper management of infection were confirmed to every patient.

Patient was premedicated by IV ranitidine 50 mg, midazolam 0.05 mg/kg and atropine 20µg/kg immediately before admission to the operating room.

On admission to the operating room, Standard monitoring included 5 leads ECG, non-invasive blood pressure, Pulse Oximetry and End-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) trace were applied (B40i Monitor - GE Healthcare, Finland).

Anesthesia was induced with IV propofol 2 mg/kg and fentanyl 1 µg/kg was given for analgesia. Cisatracurium 0.15 mg/kg IV was given to facilitate direct laryngoscopy and orotracheal intubation. The patient was ventilated at tidal volume 6-8mL/kg and respiratory rate that achieved ETCO2 of 30-35 mmHg. Oropharyngeal pack was inserted.

Anesthesia was maintained by isoflurane based on MAC 1.2 % until a steady state of anesthesia was achieved (defined as a state of anesthesia when no changes in hemodynamic variables take place for at least 10 min). An increase of ≥ 20% of basal value in both HR and MAP was treated with increasing the concentration of isoflurane by 0.5% and increments of fentanyl 1 μg/kg. Muscle relaxation was confirmed by cisatracurium 0.03mg/kg every 20 mins. IV lactated ringer solution was infused at approximately 6ml/kg/hr till the end of the procedure.

All patients were positioned supine and the bed-head of the surgical table was raised by 30° to improve venous drainage.

Before the beginning of surgical procedure, well wrung out cotton pledgets soaked with 4 ml of 2% lignocaine with 1:200,000 adrenaline were topically applied to the nasal mucous membrane for 10 min (no infiltration).

Technique for hemodynamic optimization:

Target mean arterial pressure (MAP) was 60-70 mmHg during the surgical procedure to achieve Fromm and Boezaart category scale of 2 or 3 which is judged to be optimal for surgery (20).

If the MAP was still ˃70mmHg in spite of increasing isoflurane inhalation to 2.5%, nitroglycerine (1-10 μg/kg/min.) titrated to effect.

If the heart rate was more than 100 beats/ minute, propranolol was titrated 1-3 mg/hour to achieve target MAP.

If mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased to less than 60 mm Hg, ephedrine in increments of 3 mg was given.

Withdrawal vasoactive agents:

After recording the surgeons' opinion regarding the surgical field and about 15 minutes before ending surgery, the infusion of any vasoactive medication (if used) was stopped and the anesthetic agent was decreased allowing HR and MAP to return to their basal value. If Hypotension (defined as SAP< 90mmHg and bradycardia less than 60 bpm) persisted, they was treated by ephedrine in increments of 3 mg .

On compilation of surgical procedure, anesthesia was discontinued and reversal of neuromuscular blockade was achieved using IV neostigmine 0.08 mg/kg and atropine 20µg/kg. After removal of oropharyngeal pack, oropharyngeal suction was performed. On the start of obeying commands, patients were extubated and shifted to recovery room.

Patients were discharged to the ward after reaching a score ≥ 9 on the Modified Aldrete Scoring System.

During postoperative period up to 6 hours, the patient was monitored for conscious level, oxygen saturation, heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure.

On ward admission, IM diclofenac sodium 75mg was given then every 12 hours. If the patient complained moderate to severe pain (VAS≥ 4) meperidine 25mg increments up to pain relief (maximum 100mg as a single dose) was given."

If the MAP was still ˃70mmHg in spite of increasing isoflurane inhalation to 2.5%, nitroglycerine (1-10 μg/kg/min.) titrated to effect.

If the heart rate was more than 100 beats/ minute, propranolol was titrated 1-3 mg/hour to achieve target MAP.

If mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased to less than 60 mm Hg, ephedrine in increments of 3 mg was given.

Withdrawal vasoactive agents:

After recording the surgeons' opinion regarding the surgical field and about 15 minutes before ending surgery, the infusion of any vasoactive medication (if used) was stopped and the anesthetic agent was decreased allowing HR and MAP to return to their basal value. If Hypotension (defined as SAP< 90mmHg and bradycardia less than 60 bpm) persisted, they was treated by ephedrine in increments of 3 mg .

On compilation of surgical procedure, anesthesia was discontinued and reversal of neuromuscular blockade was achieved using IV neostigmine 0.08 mg/kg and atropine 20µg/kg. After removal of oropharyngeal pack, oropharyngeal suction was performed. On the start of obeying commands, patients were extubated and shifted to recovery room.

Patients were discharged to the ward after reaching a score ≥ 9 on the Modified Aldrete Scoring System.

During postoperative period up to 6 hours, the patient was monitored for conscious level, oxygen saturation, heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure.

On ward admission, IM diclofenac sodium 75mg was given then every 12 hours. If the patient complained moderate to severe pain (VAS≥ 4) meperidine 25mg increments up to pain relief (maximum 100mg as a single dose) was given."

Technical design:

A) Site of study :

The study was conducted at Anesthesia and Surgical intensive care and Otorhinolaryngology departments, faculty of medicine, Zagazig University.

B) Sample Size :

According to 80% power of the study, 95% CI and calculated volume of blood loss 200±40 ml and 150±55ml on Gabapentin (22) and Bisoprolol (15) premedication respectively, the estimated Sample size was 54 patients (open EPI) , 63 patients were included in the study to compensate for drop out.

Randomization was carried out on 63 patients to compensate for drop out . All planned ESS procedures was managed by the same anesthetist and surgeon who were blinded to the used study's premedication. The surgeon was blinded to the monitor recording the hemodynamic variables.

All patients had been preoperatively evaluated according to standard local protocol. Preoperative surgical preparation and proper management of infection were confirmed to every patient.

Patient was premedicated by IV ranitidine 50 mg, midazolam 0.05 mg/kg and atropine 20µg/kg immediately before admission to the operating room.

On admission to the operating room, Standard monitoring included 5 leads ECG, non-invasive blood pressure, Pulse Oximetry and End-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) trace were applied (B40i Monitor - GE Healthcare, Finland).

Anesthesia was induced with IV propofol 2 mg/kg and fentanyl 1 µg/kg was given for analgesia. Cisatracurium 0.15 mg/kg IV was given to facilitate direct laryngoscopy and orotracheal intubation. The patient was ventilated at tidal volume 6-8mL/kg and respiratory rate that achieved ETCO2 of 30-35 mmHg. Oropharyngeal pack was inserted.

Anesthesia was maintained by isoflurane based on MAC 1.2 % until a steady state of anesthesia was achieved (defined as a state of anesthesia when no changes in hemodynamic variables take place for at least 10 min). An increase of ≥ 20% of basal value in both HR and MAP was treated with increasing the concentration of isoflurane by 0.5% and increments of fentanyl 1 μg/kg. Muscle relaxation was confirmed by cisatracurium 0.03mg/kg every 20 mins. IV lactated ringer solution was infused at approximately 6ml/kg/hr till the end of the procedure.

All patients were positioned supine and the bed-head of the surgical table was raised by 30° to improve venous drainage.

Before the beginning of surgical procedure, well wrung out cotton pledgets soaked with 4 ml of 2% lignocaine with 1:200,000 adrenaline were topically applied to the nasal mucous membrane for 10 min (no infiltration).

324,NCT01546857,Quality of Sleep.,Primary,['Degenerative Arthritis and Postoperative Pain'],Degenerative Arthritis and Postoperative Pain,"The Effect of Gabapentin on Postoperative Pain: a Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Trial","Recent studies have also supported the use of gabapentin as an adjuvant medication in postoperative pain management. Gabapentin decreased the pain associated with movement in post-mastectomy patients. Gilron et al showed a combination of gabapentin and rofecoxib superior to either medication alone in relieving pain after hysterectomy. Later, Gilron et al showed that adding meloxicam to gabapentin in patients undergoing outpatient laparoscopic surgery provided little additional benefit. Clarke et al demonstrated the decrease in the use of opioids in patients who received preoperative and postoperative gabapentin after total knee arthroplasty. They also noted that optimum timing and dosage of the gabapentin needed to be further elucidated. However, in the same year, Clarke et al also reported that gabapentin provided no benefit after total hip arthroplasty when a robust multimodal analgesic regimen was combined with spinal anesthesia. The side effects of gabapentin include sleepiness, which may be of benefit in the postoperative period. In a meta-analysis, Peng showed a 35 % decrease in total opioid consumption in the first 24 hours postoperatively. However, they did note an increase in sleepiness and dizziness. While a recent investigation did not find a connection between sleep disturbances and postoperative pain, a questionnaire study found that the most common reason for nighttime awakenings was pain, and that analgesia was the most helpful intervention. Gabapentin, a structural analogue to y-aminobutyric acid, has been shown in healthy subjects to increase SWS; maintain a stable REM; and reduce arousals, awakenings, and stage shifts-all of which are features of sleep fragmentation. Gabapentin is currently used to treat epilepsy, diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, as well as restless legs syndrome, and its effect on sleep patterns may attribute to its therapeutic success with these disorders Sleep deviates from the normal sleeping pattern in the postoperative patient. Total sleep time, proportion of REM sleep, and proportion of slow wave sleep (SWS) are all reduced. Sleep postoperatively tends to be highly fragmented with multiple spontaneous awakenings and movement arousals. Most of these changes occur during postoperative days 1 and 2; however, patients also incur a REM sleep rebound in days 3 and 4 that can extend up to a week. Studies have demonstrated that these postoperative sleep disturbances, notably the prolonged REM sleep rebound, may contribute to the development of altered mental function, postoperative episodic hypoxemia, and hemodynamic instability. A recent study even found that postoperative sleep disruptions independently predicted functional limitations three months following surgery in patients who underwent total knee replacement. The pathogenesis of these sleep changes appears to be strongly correlated to the magnitude of the surgery as opposed to the type of anesthesia used. Many specific mediators of surgical stress response have been indicated, including catecholamines, cortisol, and IL-1; however, as REM sleep is controlled by many regions of the brain, disturbances may be due to a global excitatory CNS effect.

Our study will recruit 90 patients between the ages of 18 and 70 who are undergoing total hip arthroplasty, hip fracture repair, or total knee arthroplasty and have been assigned an ASA rating of I-III, who are not pregnant. After Institutional Review Board approval, a written informed consent will be obtained from the patient. The study protocol, use of the Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) pump, sleep scale, sedation scale, and visual analogue scale for pain will all be explained. Demographic information will be obtained including age, gender, past medical history, past surgical history, hospitalizations, current medications, allergies, and history of drug and alcohol abuse. In addition, a preoperative sleep history will be obtained using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) [14, 15]. The 50 patients will be randomized into two groups: (1) placebo, (2) gabapentin. An Excel generated randomization schedule will be employed. The dosage of gabapentin administered will be 400mg.

Prior to surgery, all patients will be administered midazolam 1-3mg IV to achieve anxiolysis. They will also receive a lumbar plexus block or a femoral nerve block, depending on the surgery to be done, as this has become the standard of care for orthopedic patients at University Hospital. All patients will receive celecoxib 200 mg po bid for three postoperative days. In the operating room, standard general anesthesia technique will be utilized. Upon extubation, the patient will be transferred to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), where baseline pain and sedation scores will be obtained using the Visual Acuity Scale (VAS), the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), and Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS), respectively. All pain scores will be assessed with subjects in the resting position. A continuous infusion of bupivacaine 0.125mg/L will be started at a rate of 10mL/hr and continued to postoperative day 2. An I.V. PCA hydromorphone pump will be initiated and set to deliver a 0.2mg bolus per demand with a 5 minute lockout and no background infusion. All patients will be instructed to maintain their VAS pain score at less than 4 out of 10. If the VAS pain score is 5 or greater at rest on two consecutive pain assessments, the dose of intravenous PCA hydromorphone will be increased to deliver a 0.3mg bolus per demand.

At approximately 9pm on the day of the procedure the first dose of placebo/gabapentin will be given. The gabapentin or placebo treatment will be given once more at 9 pm on postoperative day 1. The surgical team will be asked not to order any additional medication for sleep. The following mornings, on POD1 and POD2, a questionnaire addressing the quality of sleep, hours of sleep, number of awakenings throughout the night, and contributing reasons for these awakenings (pain, noise, urination, temperature discomfort, positional discomfort, for nursing care, or other reasons) will be given. Patients will also be assessed for pain, sedation, as well as the incidence of any side effects, including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and pruritus. In addition, all patients will begin an as-tolerated weight-bearing rehabilitation program for range of motion, strengthening, balance and ambulation beginning the first day after surgery. Success in completion of the physical therapy goals of being out of bed in a chair by postop day 1 and ambulating by postop day 2 will be determined for each group.

The purpose of this study is to determine if a single dose of gabapentin decrease patients' postoperative pain. The primary endpoint will be opioid consumption; additional assessments will include: subjective sleep scales, pain scores, and patient's ability to reach postoperative rehabilitation goals"
325,NCT01546857,Opioid Consumption,Primary,['Degenerative Arthritis and Postoperative Pain'],Degenerative Arthritis and Postoperative Pain,"The Effect of Gabapentin on Postoperative Pain: a Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo Controlled Trial","Recent studies have also supported the use of gabapentin as an adjuvant medication in postoperative pain management. Gabapentin decreased the pain associated with movement in post-mastectomy patients. Gilron et al showed a combination of gabapentin and rofecoxib superior to either medication alone in relieving pain after hysterectomy. Later, Gilron et al showed that adding meloxicam to gabapentin in patients undergoing outpatient laparoscopic surgery provided little additional benefit. Clarke et al demonstrated the decrease in the use of opioids in patients who received preoperative and postoperative gabapentin after total knee arthroplasty. They also noted that optimum timing and dosage of the gabapentin needed to be further elucidated. However, in the same year, Clarke et al also reported that gabapentin provided no benefit after total hip arthroplasty when a robust multimodal analgesic regimen was combined with spinal anesthesia. The side effects of gabapentin include sleepiness, which may be of benefit in the postoperative period. In a meta-analysis, Peng showed a 35 % decrease in total opioid consumption in the first 24 hours postoperatively. However, they did note an increase in sleepiness and dizziness. While a recent investigation did not find a connection between sleep disturbances and postoperative pain, a questionnaire study found that the most common reason for nighttime awakenings was pain, and that analgesia was the most helpful intervention. Gabapentin, a structural analogue to y-aminobutyric acid, has been shown in healthy subjects to increase SWS; maintain a stable REM; and reduce arousals, awakenings, and stage shifts-all of which are features of sleep fragmentation. Gabapentin is currently used to treat epilepsy, diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, as well as restless legs syndrome, and its effect on sleep patterns may attribute to its therapeutic success with these disorders Sleep deviates from the normal sleeping pattern in the postoperative patient. Total sleep time, proportion of REM sleep, and proportion of slow wave sleep (SWS) are all reduced. Sleep postoperatively tends to be highly fragmented with multiple spontaneous awakenings and movement arousals. Most of these changes occur during postoperative days 1 and 2; however, patients also incur a REM sleep rebound in days 3 and 4 that can extend up to a week. Studies have demonstrated that these postoperative sleep disturbances, notably the prolonged REM sleep rebound, may contribute to the development of altered mental function, postoperative episodic hypoxemia, and hemodynamic instability. A recent study even found that postoperative sleep disruptions independently predicted functional limitations three months following surgery in patients who underwent total knee replacement. The pathogenesis of these sleep changes appears to be strongly correlated to the magnitude of the surgery as opposed to the type of anesthesia used. Many specific mediators of surgical stress response have been indicated, including catecholamines, cortisol, and IL-1; however, as REM sleep is controlled by many regions of the brain, disturbances may be due to a global excitatory CNS effect.

Our study will recruit 90 patients between the ages of 18 and 70 who are undergoing total hip arthroplasty, hip fracture repair, or total knee arthroplasty and have been assigned an ASA rating of I-III, who are not pregnant. After Institutional Review Board approval, a written informed consent will be obtained from the patient. The study protocol, use of the Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) pump, sleep scale, sedation scale, and visual analogue scale for pain will all be explained. Demographic information will be obtained including age, gender, past medical history, past surgical history, hospitalizations, current medications, allergies, and history of drug and alcohol abuse. In addition, a preoperative sleep history will be obtained using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) [14, 15]. The 50 patients will be randomized into two groups: (1) placebo, (2) gabapentin. An Excel generated randomization schedule will be employed. The dosage of gabapentin administered will be 400mg.

Prior to surgery, all patients will be administered midazolam 1-3mg IV to achieve anxiolysis. They will also receive a lumbar plexus block or a femoral nerve block, depending on the surgery to be done, as this has become the standard of care for orthopedic patients at University Hospital. All patients will receive celecoxib 200 mg po bid for three postoperative days. In the operating room, standard general anesthesia technique will be utilized. Upon extubation, the patient will be transferred to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), where baseline pain and sedation scores will be obtained using the Visual Acuity Scale (VAS), the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS), and Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS), respectively. All pain scores will be assessed with subjects in the resting position. A continuous infusion of bupivacaine 0.125mg/L will be started at a rate of 10mL/hr and continued to postoperative day 2. An I.V. PCA hydromorphone pump will be initiated and set to deliver a 0.2mg bolus per demand with a 5 minute lockout and no background infusion. All patients will be instructed to maintain their VAS pain score at less than 4 out of 10. If the VAS pain score is 5 or greater at rest on two consecutive pain assessments, the dose of intravenous PCA hydromorphone will be increased to deliver a 0.3mg bolus per demand.

At approximately 9pm on the day of the procedure the first dose of placebo/gabapentin will be given. The gabapentin or placebo treatment will be given once more at 9 pm on postoperative day 1. The surgical team will be asked not to order any additional medication for sleep.

The proposed Exploratory Development research project is a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial comparing the efficacy of gabapentin to placebo for the outpatient treatment of benzodiazepine dependence. The goal of this project is to study the effects of gabapentin on the participants' benzodiazepine use in a facilitated taper-to-abstinence model, where participants will be actively using benzodiazepines at study entry, gabapentin treatment will be introduced, and participants will be counseled to gradually discontinue benzodiazepine use over the study period while gabapentin treatment is maintained. A modified version of Medical Management will be used to facilitate compliance with study medication and other study procedures, and includes clinical instruction for gradually reducing benzodiazepine use 25% per week. Benzodiazepines are not prescribed in the proposed study; participants continue to obtain benzodiazepines from their own prescribed or nonprescribed sources."

How this negative state results in chronic pain and disability is not known, but we hypothesize that it causes dysfunction of the release of the neurotransmitter, norepinephrine in several regions of the brain, mid-brain, and spinal cord that are important to many processes involved in recovery from surgery.

Objectives: (1) Gabapentin and modafinil will increase resting pupil diameter with a moderate effect size in patients with osteoarthritis; (2) Expectations will modify pain experience with a moderate effect size in these patients

Methods: 30 subjects with moderate average daily pain from osteoarthritis of the knee or hip or healthy subjects will be recruited and will come to the clinical research unit at Wake Forest. Informed consent will be confirmed and they will complete the questionnaires. We will take a verbal medical and medication history and obtain blood pressure and heart rate measurements. Verbal pain intensity report (0-10 from no pain to worst pain imaginable) will be obtained from a 5 second heat stimuli, separated by 30 seconds, delivered to a nonpainful area of skin on the arm as described in preliminary data. During pain testing, study subjects will sit in a comfortable chair in a low-ambient light room with their head positioned on a chin rest for continuous recording of pupil diameter using a near infrared recording system as described in preliminary data. Pupil diameter and probe temperature will be passed through an analog to digital converter and acquired at 60 Hertz (Hz) for subsequent analysis.

Five sequences of test stimuli will be presented, with a brief break in between each sequence. The first sequence will consist of 7 stimuli, from 39⁰ to 51⁰ Celsius (C) in 2⁰C increments, in ascending order. Data from this training sequence will not be used for analysis. Sequences 2 and 3 will consist of 5, 5-second stimuli, presented in random order, to generate moderate (50⁰C) and mild (47⁰C) pain (random condition). Sequences 4 and 5 will also consist of random presentation of 5 stimuli at these temperatures, but with different auditory tones 6 s prior to stimulus onset to correctly cue the stimulus temperature (cued condition).

Subjects will then be randomized to receive oral gabapentin, 900 milligram (mg), modafinil, 200 mg, or placebo, followed 2 hours later by pain testing with pupillometry, consisting of different sequences. The random and cued paradigms will be presented twice each followed by a sequence with one miscue in the positive expectation for pain direction (signal for 50⁰C but deliver 47⁰C) and one in the negative expectation for pain direction. Subjects will provide verbal pain intensity scores after each stimulus."

The random and cued paradigms will be presented twice each followed by a sequence with one miscue in the positive expectation for pain direction (signal for 50⁰C but deliver 47⁰C) and one in the negative expectation for pain direction. Subjects will provide verbal pain intensity scores after each stimulus."
